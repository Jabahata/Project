        <h1>Let's talk about Bitcoin</h1>
        <p>The Bitcoin supply was capped from the beginning by Nakamoto. The maximum number of coins stipulated to be in existence was 21 million. As of Nov. 12, 2023, there were 19.53 million Bitcoins in existence with 1.46 million left to be mined. However, the Bitcoin mining operators regularly cut in half the rewards for mining each block in a process known as Bitcoin halving, leading experts to believe that it will take until the year 2140 before the supply cap of 21 million is reached.</p>
	<p>After Nakamoto rolled out Bitcoin in 2009, he mined about 1.1 million Bitcoins and disappeared in 2010. He ceded the responsibility of development to Gavin Andresen, formerly known as Gavin Bell, who worked to see Bitcoin's decentralized vision realized. This meant that there was no central authority, server, storage or administrator. All the parties were peer-to-peer and the blockchain was distributed to all. The network existed merely to legitimize and confirm the transactions. The price of Bitcoin dropped with the new uncertainty surrounding these actions.<p>
	<p>However, control issues emerged when GHash.io, a cryptocurrency mining pool, exceeded 51% hashing power for the first time. One of Bitcoin's tenets is that power cannot be accumulated in too few hands, and GHash's popularity meant that coins could be double-spent, or counterfeited, and they could push other miners out of being rewarded for their activity. Fortunately for the Bitcoin industry, the parties voluntarily enacted provisions that redistributed hashing power to acceptable, sustainable limits.<p>
	<p>The first real-world Bitcoin transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, a date known to Bitcoin enthusiasts now as Bitcoin Pizza Day. Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC to have two Papa John's pizzas delivered to him. The pizzas retailed for about $25. At the peak of Bitcoin's pricing in 2021, the two pizzas would have cost north of $680 million. Due to Bitcoin's extreme volatility, the pizzas would currently be worth about $250 million.<p>
	<p>Part of Bitcoin's volatility comes from the Gartner Hype Cycle, a life cycle common among new and innovative technologies. The five stages include the innovation trigger, the peak of inflated expectations, the trough of disillusionment, the slope of enlightenment and the plateau of productivity. Many individuals created and then lost vast fortunes in Bitcoin, causing eight Nobel Prize winners in economic sciences to call Bitcoin a bubble, much like the oft-cited Dutch tulip mania in the 1600s. However, Bitcoin supporters point out that although Bitcoin has crashed several times, it has also returned to its previous price each time, while other bubbles have not recovered their value.<p>
	<p>The questionable strength of the economy has also been a huge factor in Bitcoin pricing. In what has been called the 2022 "crypto winter," sharp declines occurred in Bitcoin pricing as the Federal Reserve began aggressively increasing interest rates to stave off inflation. Investor appetite for risk all but disappeared and liquidity became a major issue among the exchanges.<p>
